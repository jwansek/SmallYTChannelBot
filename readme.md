# About the database's structure

`users` is where usernames and the scores are kept. `lambdas` is for every
time a lambda is given. Is linked to `users`. `stats` keeps unique users (just
the amount of users in `users`), the total lambda in circulation (everyone's
lambda scores summed), and the times help given, which is just the sum of every
unique entry in `lambdas`. `blacklist` is the reddit id of every comment / 
submission the bot has dealt with. If running on a new system you'll need to
update this. You can do this using archive_posts.py
