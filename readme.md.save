#/u/SmallYTChannelBot Source Code

- database.py is for interfacing with the SQLite database

- I chose SQLite instead of MySQL so it's easy to backup

- I backup here every so often, but it is likely to be out of date.
If I die and someone needs to take over the source code, you'll have to
write a script that reads everyone's flairs in the subreddit.

- ytapi.py is for getting information about videos using the YouTube API
